# Udacity-Bikeshare-project
The Udacity Bikeshare project is a hands-on data analysis project offered by Udacity as part of their Data Analyst Nanodegree program. The project focuses on analyzing bike-sharing data from three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C.
The project involves writing Python code to import and explore large datasets, as well as using various statistical and analytical techniques to extract meaningful insights from the data. The goal of the project is to gain insights into bike-sharing patterns and user behavior in each city.

The project typically consists of the following main tasks:

Data Wrangling: The first step involves importing and cleaning the raw data. 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Once the data is cleaned, EDA techniques are applied to gain an initial understanding of the dataset. This  involves calculating basic statistics, and exploring relationships between variables.

Descriptive Statistics: In this step, more in-depth analysis is performed to answer specific questions about the dataset. This  includes calculating summary statistics, identifying trends and patterns, and comparing different cities or time periods.

User Interaction: interactivity is added to the analysis using user inputs. Users can interact with the program to filter and display specific information or explore the data from different perspectives.

The Udacity Bikeshare project provides an opportunity to apply data analysis techniques to real-world data and gain practical experience in data manipulation, exploration, and visualization using Python and popular libraries such as pandas and Matplotlib.

Overall, the project helped me develop critical data analysis skills and gain hands-on experience in working with large datasets, performing statistical analysis, and communicating insights effectively.
Major libraries used in this project include Numpy and Pandas
